# Tank Battle Aim Assistant

## Overview

The Tank Battle Aim Assistant is a tool designed to enhance gameplay for tank-based strategy games. By analyzing screenshots, the tool identifies key game elements such as tanks and obstacles and computes the optimal firing solution in terms of angle and power, taking into account environmental factors like wind.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Converts screenshots into a map of relevant game objects.
- **Object Detection**: Locates and marks tanks and other important objects.
- **Trajectory Calculation**: Uses physics to determine the best shot.
- **Wind Adjustment**: Considers wind speed for accurate aiming.
- **Visual Testing Environment**: Provides a Pygame-based interface for visual verification.
